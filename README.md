## Basic Details

### Team Name: Stack Overlords

### Team Members
- Member 1: E M Mohammed Sinan - College of Engineering Trivandrum
- Member 2: Ken Mani Binu - College of Engineering Trivandrum
- Member 3: Thankan himself 
### Project Description
Thankan.Ayyo is an AI-powered Malayali uncle chatbot that gives unsolicited advice, sarcastic remarks, and random life stories — sometimes even answering your actual questions. It has two modes:  
- **Thankan Chettan Mode**: Your friendly, sarcastic uncle.  
- **Thani Thankan Mode**: The unfiltered, verbally abusive OG uncle — brutal but funny.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People today have too much peace and too little unsolicited advice.  
No one is interrupting our conversations with random nonsense, sarcastic boasts, and unsolicited rants anymore.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We trained an AI uncle who:
- Gives advice you never asked for.
- Randomly changes topics mid-conversation.
- Can roast you like your own relatives at a wedding.
- Switches to “full savage mode” with just one click.
